All around the Aelzerian Rift, you can acquire Ancient Enchantments. These are similar to Ultimate Enchants in the way that they provide niche or stronger buffs, but unlike Ultimates - they have durability and can stack with multiple.

Enchantments:
  - Ancient Enchantment: Berserker Flux (3% chance) [Exc-C] (Melee Weapons)
    750 Durability. Costs 1 Durability on kill.
    Increases the amount of damage dealt by melee attacks based on the sum of your Berserker (+subclasses) class levels.
      Bonus Damage: [(T + 5) * 0.2]% (T = sum of Berserker class levels)
      Combining extra Berserker Flux books onto a melee weapon which already has Berserker Flux refreshes the enchantment's durability.

  - Ancient Enchantment: Arrow Flux (5% chance) [Exc-C] (Ranged Weapons)
    1,000 Durability. Costs 1 Durability on kill.
    Allows projectiles to apply Life Steal, with 10% efficiency per book.
      Life Steal Efficiency: [books * 10]%
      Combining extra Arrow Flux blocks onto a melee weapon which already has Arrow Flux refreshes the enchantment's durability, and increases the life steal efficiency by 10%. Maximum of 30% efficiency.
