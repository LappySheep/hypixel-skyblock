Skill - Gathering

Starting Level: 0
Maximum Level: 101

Level 101 does not apply bonuses greater than Level 100, unless explicitly mentioned.


Gathering Efficiency gains +1 per level.
Gathering Fortune gains +1 per 5 levels.



Unlocking the Gathering Skill (after beating Floor 3), you can purchase a pair of Passed-down Gathering Gloves from Nil'Eix for 30,000 Tainted Coins.
While Gathering Gloves are in your inventory (only works with one; assumes the weakest pair), scopes may appear around dungeons.
Scopes are marked regions and using any pair of Gathering Gloves (or other special items if applicable) on them will attempt to collect special items.

- Passed-down Gathering Gloves [COMMON]
  Requires Aelzer Level 15.
  Cost: 30,000 Tainted Coins
    +2 Gathering Efficiency
    Item Passive - Irresponsible Gathering
      Common scopes gain +1 Gathering Efficiency.

Gathering Efficiency increases the chance that you successfully gather items from a scope (max 100%).
  If a scope has an item which requires 100 Gathering Efficiency, then having 50 GE will grant a 50% chance of harvesting it from the scope.

Gathering Fortune increases the chance that you gain multiple drops from a scope.
  If a scope drops 2-5 items normally, if you collect 4 items from this scope and have 40 GF, you have a 40% chance of collecting 8 items instead, and a 60% chance of collecting 4.


Global scopes are scopes that can be found across any floor, but higher rarities require a minimum floor. Local scopes are scopes that are only found on a specific floor.

Floors:
  Floor 1 - Common, +0% scope spawns
  Floor 2 - Common, +5% scope spawns
  Floor 3 - Common-Uncommon, +10% scope spawns
  Floor 4 - Common-Uncommon, +16% scope spawns
  Floor 5 - Common-Rare, +23% scope spawns
  Floor 6 - Common-Rare, +30% scope spawns
  Floor 7 - Common-Epic, +38% scope spawns
  Floor 8 - Common-Epic, +57% scope spawns
  Floor 9 - Common-Legendary, +66% scope spawns
  Floor 10 - Common-Legendary, +76% scope spawns
  Floor 11 - Common-Legendary, +87% scope spawns
  Floor 12 - Common-Legendary, +98% scope spawns
  Floor 13 - Common-Legendary, +110% scope spawns

Rarity Ratios:
  Common: 50% chance
  Uncommon: 25% chance
  Rare: 15% chance
  Epic: 8% chance
  Legendary: 2% chance


Scopes can be harvested multiple times before they expire. All scopes have a minimum gather count of 2, increased by 1 for every 20 Gathering levels (7 at level 100). Only fully harvested scopes count towards dungeon score (does not have to be successful).

Scopes will only award one type of item or resource each - the same scope will not give you two different items.


Scopes can be found in many different places, but some places require additional gear or items to be gathered. Using incorrect gear for these other scopes will significantly reduce the likelihood of success. If a skill exp requirement is present, but not met, then the likelihood of success is reduced by 80%. Success reduction modifiers stack multiplicatively.

Types:
  - Normal (Any)

  - Mining (Pickaxes)
    Incorrect Gear: -80% Success Rate

  - Woodcutting (Axes)
    Incorrect Gear: -80% Success Rate

  - Fishing (Fishing Rods, Harpoons, Fishing Gloves)
    Incorrect Gear (Gathering Gloves): -80% Success Rate
    Incorrect Gear (Other): -100% Success Rate

  - Hunting (Weapons)

    Incorrect Gear (Other): -100% Success Rate
