Unlocking the Gathering Skill (after beating Floor 3), you can purchase a pair of Passed-down Gathering Gloves from Nil'Eix for 30,000 Tainted Coins.
While Gathering Gloves are in your inventory (only works with one; assumes the weakest pair), scopes may appear around dungeons.
Scopes are marked regions and using any pair of Gathering Gloves on them will attempt to collect special items.

- Passed-down Gathering Gloves [COMMON]
  Requires Aelzer Level 15.
  Cost: 30,000 Tainted Coins
    +2 Gathering Efficiency
    Item Passive - Irresponsible Gathering
      Common scopes gain +1 Gathering Efficiency.

Gathering Efficiency increases the chance that you successfully gather items from a scope (max 100%).
  If a scope has an item which requires 100 Gathering Efficiency, then having 50 GE will grant a 50% chance of harvesting it from the scope.

Gathering Fortune increases the chance that you gain multiple drops from a scope.
  If a scope drops 2-4 items normally, having 50 GF means a 50% chance of getting 2-4 items, and a 50% chance of getting 4-8 items.


Global scopes are scopes that can be found across any floor, but higher rarities require a minimum floor. Local scopes are scopes that are only found on a specific floor.
