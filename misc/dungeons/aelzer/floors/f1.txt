Puzzles:
  - Stone Inverter
    6x4 stone/cobblestone block array, each block with a button on it.
    Example:
      c s s c s s
      s c s s s c
      c s c s c s
      s c s s s c
    Clicking a button inverts the 5 blocks vertically/horizontally adjacent and the main block (selecting the slot diagonally down/right from the top left):
      c c s c s s
      c s c s s c
      c c c s c s
      s c s s s c
    Getting a full array of stone blocks completes the puzzle.

  - Laser Pierce
    7x7x16 long cuboid of stone, walls closest to the 7x7 faces are replaced with sea lanterns. One of the stone blocks in the cuboid is replaced with an obsidian block.
    Shooting an arrow at a lantern marks it with red wool, and shooting one on the other wall marks it with a red glass block. Afterwards, a laser pierces from the wool to the glass, removing all stone it touches. If it pierces the obsidian, it stops.
    Using a maximum of 6 lasers, pierce the obsidian block twice to complete the puzzle.
    You are able to reset the puzzle, but doing so places the puzzle on a 60 second cooldown. Resetting the puzzle does not change the position of the obsidian.
