Floor 3

Size: 6x6


Green Room

3 Pod Rooms
  Pod rooms are special rooms which are spawned close to the green room. Each pod room contains a small crystal in the centre. When all players in a party are in the room, the door locks and the crystal begins to charge.
  Floor 3 Pod Charge Rate: 0.6s/% (60s for full charge)
    While the crystal is charging, monsters that spawn in other normal rooms will begin to spawn, and will attempt to attack the pod. Each monster attack reduces the crystal's charge by 5%. Players can draw aggro from monsters to prevent this.
    If the crystal hits 0%, the door unlocks and the crystal stops charging with no reward.
    If the crystal hits 100%, the door unlocks and every player is granted a stat bonus.
  Floor 3 Pod Stat Bonus: +8% per pod.

Boss Room:
  Entering the Boss Room requires all party members to be ready. When all members are ready, the boss begins.



Boss - Tsra'ki

When entering the room, nothing happens for a short while.
After 4 seconds, 12 vines grow around the edge of the room - 4 in the corners and 8 on the sides. Each vine is equidistant from each other.
After the vines grow, Tsra'ki appears in the centre.
Tsra'ki is invulnerable.

** Phase 1 **

"Do you see these vines? They rise up when tresspassers arrive here."

"You are tresspassing in my domain."

Weak Vine
  Cannot be damaged.
  Abilities:
    - Slowing Aura:
      Players within 2 blocks of a Weak Vine are slowed by 50%.
    - Vine Struggle:
      Players, and Tsra'ki, are stunned for 4 seconds if they come into contact with a Weak Vine.
      Tsra'ki loses his invulnerability shield if stunned by a Weak Vine.

Tsra'ki must be stunned by a Weak Vine in order to be damaged. While stunned, players must deal a minimum of 1,000,000 damage. Tsra'ki has 4,000,000 Health and will restore 1,000,000 Health back after the end of each stun.

Tsra'ki's Abilities:
  - Magma Blast:
    Shoot a high velocity fireball at a target. Deals up to 12,000 damage and high knockback to targets near impact.
  - Chains of Hell:
    Create chains that link to every target within 5 blocks. Deal 300 true damage per second to every target for the next 10 seconds. If a target exceeds a distance of 14 blocks from Tsra'ki, the chain breaks and they take 8,000 damage instantly.
        

At 1 HP left, phase 2 begins.


** Phase 2 **

"You won't be doing that again."

Tsra'ki removes eight of the twelve vines, only leaving the ones in the corners.

Stronger Vine
  Cannot be damaged.
  Abilities:
    - Slowing Aura:
      Players within 2 blocks of a Stronger Vine are slowed by 75%.
    - Vine Struggle:
      Players, and Tsra'ki, are stunned for 4 seconds if they come into contact with a Stronger Vine.
      Tsra'ki loses his invulnerability shield if stunned by a Stronger Vine.

Phase 2 is similar to phase 1, except Tsra'ki only has 1,750,000 Health, and fully heals if not killed after being stunned. You only need to stun/hurt him once.

Tsra'ki's Abilities:
  - Magma Blast:
    Shoot a high velocity fireball at a target. Deals up to 20,000 damage and high knockback to targets near impact.
  - Chains of Hell:
    Create chains that link to every target within 5 blocks. Deal 400 true damage per second to every target for the next 10 seconds. If a target exceeds a distance of 17 blocks from Tsra'ki, the chain breaks and they take 16,000 damage instantly.
  - Scorching Gust:
    Shoot a quick bolt of fire at a target, setting them on fire for 12 seconds. Every half-second, they take 3% of their maximum health as physical damage.


At 1 HP left, phase 3 begins.


** Phase 3 **

"Do you know why I have vines in my domain? No?"

"You will find out very shortly. Sadly for you, you won't be leaving with this information."

Tsra'ki kills off the four corner vines and channels energy into the centre of the room.
A large vine grows.

"Aeren was not wise to leave the Hybrid alone. You will see now why I am the fastest entity in this realm."

Central Vine
  Cannot be damaged.
  Abilities:
    - Smothering Branch
      Players that touch the Central Vine are stunned for 3 seconds.

Tsra'ki in this phase has 4 HP.
He cannot take damage from normal sources.
He will continue to circle around the Central Vine, shooting arrows at players occasionally.
Arrows that he shoots deal up to 17,250 damage each.

During phase 3, Tsra'ki spawns Hybrid monsters.
Killing Hybrid in this phase increases Tsra'ki's rage meter, and at 100%, he stops moving, and charges towards a certain player after 2 seconds.
Players have to stand opposite to Tsra'ki, such that he bumps into the Central Vine. This stuns him and deals 1 damage.

Rage Meter:
  - Fills up by 1% passively, every second.
  - Hybrid Reavers fill up the meter by 7%.
  - Hybrid Destroyers fill up the meter by 9%.
  - Hybrid Stalkers fill up the meter by 10%.

Each time that Tsra'ki bumps into the Central Vine,
  - Tsra'ki moves a few blocks away from the Vine, making it harder to align him towards the centre.
  - Tsra'ki moves 25% faster than the normal speed.
  - Tsra'ki takes 0.5 seconds less time before charging towards a player.
  - Hybrids have 25% more HP/shields.

Tsra'ki's Abilities:
  - Magma Blast:
    Shoot a high velocity fireball at a target. Deals up to 32,000 damage and high knockback to targets near impact.
  - Chains of Hell:
    Create chains that link to every target within 5 blocks. Deal 500 true damage per second to every target for the next 10 seconds. If a target exceeds a distance of 20 blocks from Tsra'ki, the chain breaks and they take 32,000 damage instantly.
  - Scorching Gust:
    Shoot a quick bolt of fire at a target, setting them on fire for 15 seconds. Every half-second, they take 4% of their maximum health as physical damage.
  - Infernal Wind:
    If a target is on fire, Tsra'ki can shoot a cinder flame at them, refreshing their burning time duration and dealing 20% of their missing health as true damage.


At 0 HP, Tsra'ki has been defeated.

"Not again..."
