Floor 2

Size: 6x5


Green Room

3 Pod Rooms
  Pod rooms are special rooms which are spawned close to the green room. Each pod room contains a small crystal in the centre. When all players in a party are in the room, the door locks and the crystal begins to charge.
  Floor 2 Pod Charge Rate: 0.4s/% (40s for full charge)
    While the crystal is charging, monsters that spawn in other normal rooms will begin to spawn, and will attempt to attack the pod. Each monster attack reduces the crystal's charge by 5%. Players can draw aggro from monsters to prevent this.
    If the crystal hits 0%, the door unlocks and the crystal stops charging with no reward.
    If the crystal hits 100%, the door unlocks and every player is granted a stat bonus.
  Floor 2 Pod Stat Bonus: +6% per pod.
    Pod stat bonuses are reduced to 0% during a boss, but can be increased using accessories.

Boss - Aeren

"You've arrived."

"You know, Vuoi'h falling in battle was the last thing I would have expected."

"There's actually an easy solution to this."

Aeren summons a wind shockwave and knocks every player to the walls. Every player is dropped to 5% of their maximum health.

"You stand here today, against me. You dare defile the Breath of Creation?"

Aeren

At 750,000 HP remaining, Aeren knocks everyone back to the walls and drops everyone to 5% of their maximum health again.
Players already below that threshold are lowered to 1 HP.

Aeren becomes invulnerable.

"Those that dare to cross me don't live to tell the tale!"

Aeren brings up 4 pillars near her which rise.
After 2 seconds, the pillars are charged with energy and they become crystals.
Each crystal shoots four lasers - one in each horizontal direction - against the walls.
The lasers start off as green.

"There can only be one punishment for trying to defeat the Breath of Creation!"

Players can now try to destroy the crystals.
Crystals have 1,750,000 HP (no defence) and after 5 seconds each, turn from green to yellow to orange to red.
Lasers destroy player projectiles and passing through a laser deals 30% of the target's maximum HP as true damage per second.

After 15 seconds, crystals are either destroyed or have red lasers.
Remaining crystals stop shooting lasers and begin circling around Aeren, blocking projectiles.
Remaining crystals also regain their life points.

Aeren is no longer invulnerable.

At 1 HP remaining, Aeren causes every player to start levitating, and she becomes invulnerable again.

"I had so many plans... so many dreams."

"They're not over yet..."

Aeren creates a glowing-red ball of energy in front of her, and it glows for 5 seconds.
Afterwards, the ball of energy opens up to reveal a Hybrid Behemoth in the middle.

"After centuries, my creation is complete."

"Promised by Xio'Eix, the first step to learning what true freedom is, all begins with this."

"My child, bring forth destruction to their lands. Do what I could not. Merge with me and become eternal - like a god!"

Aeren mixes with the Hybrid Behemoth's life force and the last stand begins.
The Behemoth creates a shockwave, dealing 84,000 damage split across all players.

Upon dying, the boss fight ends.

"They're not over yet! Not until I say they are!"
