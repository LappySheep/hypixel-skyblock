There are numerous 'modes' available, which can be picked before starting a dungeon run.

Each mode has its own features and pros/cons, which must be taken into consideration to maximise efficiency.

Some modes have requirements - which must be fulfilled before you can choose them.


General Information:
  - Dungeon score is always rounded down; 199.9999 is rounded down to 199.
  - Dungeon rank thresholds are always rounded up; 95% of 250 = 237.5 --> 238.
  - Base Aelzer Exp earned from dungeon runs is quadratically proportional to the dungeon score; 225/250 score achieved grants 81% of the maximum base experience earned.
  - Bosses account for 40% of the possible score (by default); avoiding the boss caps you at a C rank.
  - Score : Rank thresholds:
    S*: 100%, S+: 95%, S: 90%,
    A: 80%, B: 70%, C: 60%,
    D: 50%, E: <50%
  - Score reduction multipliers are additive, and apply after flat reduction (e.g. 1 death + 36 seconds over in a standard run: 250 -> 247 -> 234.65 -> rounded down to 234).
  - Default minimum score is 10% of maximum possible.
  - Leaving a dungeon run prematurely grants no Aelzer Exp at all.

        - Gain a loot rating which is random between 80% and 100% of [(Score / MaximumScore) * HighestQualityRatingItem], e.g. 200 score with rarest drop being 1% -> 0.8 -> 0.64-0.8 * 100 ==> 64 - 80 loot rating.
        - Rolling from the best possible drop, all the way down to the most common drop. Drops below 10% are considered at 10% chance for rolling.
        - If a drop is successfully rolled, remove the quality rating from your loot rating, and repeat until drops can no longer be rolled at all.
        - Any remaining loot rating afterwards buffs the Tainted Coin quantity drop by [RemainingRating / 2.5]%.

      - At any point, you can reset your Explored marks on floors - maximum of once every 72 SkyBlock hours.

        - Floor F is the highest floor that is marked with Explored; but must be consecutive with a previous Explored floor.
