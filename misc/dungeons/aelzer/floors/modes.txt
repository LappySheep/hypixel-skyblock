There are numerous 'modes' available, which can be picked before starting a dungeon run.

Each mode has its own features and pros/cons, which must be taken into consideration to maximise efficiency.

Some modes have requirements - which must be fulfilled before you can choose them.


General Information:
  - Dungeon score is always rounded down; 199.9999 is rounded down to 199.
  - Dungeon rank thresholds are always rounded up; 95% of 250 = 237.5 --> 238.
  - Base Aelzer Exp earned from dungeon runs is quadratically proportional to the dungeon score; 225/250 score achieved grants 81% of the maximum base experience earned.
  - Bosses account for 40% of the possible score (by default); avoiding the boss caps you at a C rank.
  - Score : Rank thresholds:
    S*: 100%, S+: 95%, S: 90%,
    A: 80%, B: 70%, C: 60%,
    D: 50%, E: <50%
  - Score reduction multipliers are additive, and apply after flat reduction (e.g. 1 death + 36 seconds over in a standard run: 250 -> 247 -> 234.65 -> rounded down to 234).
  - Default minimum score is 10% of maximum possible.
  - Leaving a dungeon run prematurely grants no Aelzer Exp at all.

      - Slain Digitalis (Floor 6)

    Other Notes:
      - Monsters and bosses do not drop anything in Completionist Mode, other than Tainted Coins.
      - While in Completionist Mode, completing a new floor marks it as Explored, and 20% of the Aelzer Exp earned is added to a Completionist Experience Bank (not subtracted from main exp earned).
        - Experience is only added to the bank if the floor completed is not marked as Explored, and if the previous floor (excl F1) is marked as Explored.
      - Explored floors replayed on Completionist Mode grant no bonus Aelzer Exp.
      - At any point, you can reset your Explored marks on floors - maximum of once every 72 SkyBlock hours.
      - Resetting the Explored marks on your floors earns Aelzer Exp equal to [102.5 + (F * 2.5)]% of Floor F's maximum exp, plus the experience in your Completionist Experience Bank.
        - Floor F is the highest floor that is marked with Explored; but must be consecutive with a previous Explored floor.
          e.g. F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F7 Explored floors => Floor F == Floor 5 ==> earn 115% of floor 5's maximum Aelzer Exp + Bank Exp.
    Maximum Dungeon Score: 250
