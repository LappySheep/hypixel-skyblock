I cannot understand half of the machinations that reside in this hellish place. Perhaps I was too eager.

Writing this down...

It almost feels like I have given up. Passing through the first three rooms. Each monster ravaging on my armor. To think that some of us have had to go through this suffering, but for every second of their life.

The Fallen One will not stop me. He can send his entire army and summon his strongest beasts, but I will not fall by his hand.
