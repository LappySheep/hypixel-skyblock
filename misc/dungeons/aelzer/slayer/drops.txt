Killing a Voidshade Hybrid successfully rewards you with a variety of drops. Depending on your Slayer level, you can roll multiple drops.

Slayer Level | Loot Rolls
  1 | 1 roll
  2 | 1 roll
  3 | 1 roll
  4 | 2 rolls
  5 | 2 rolls
  6 | 3 rolls
  7 | 3 rolls
  8 | 4 rolls
  9 | 5 rolls
  10 | 6 rolls
  11 | 7 rolls


Drops are separated into different 'loot tiers'. Your Slayer level affects how many rolls are possible, but the tier of Voidshade that you kill affects the maximum loot tier that you can roll.

Drop Tier: Tier Weight
  C: 100 weight
  B: 50 weight
  A: 25 weight
  S: 15 weight
  S+: 10 weight

Voidshade Tier | Maximum Loot Tier
  Rebel (T1) | C-tier Maximum
  Outlaw (T2) | C-tier Maximum
    C: 100% chance

  Bandit (T3) | B-tier Maximum
  Raider (T4) | B-tier Maximum
    C: 66.67% chance
    B: 33.33% chance

  Exile (T5) | A-tier Maximum
  Vanguard (T6) | A-tier Maximum
    C: 57.14% chance
    B: 28.57% chance
    A: 14.28% chance

  Elite Vanguard (T6b) | S-tier Maximum, cannot roll C-tier drops
    B: 55.56% chance
    A: 33.33% chance
    S: 11.11% chance

  Annihilator (T7) | S+ tier Maximum, cannot roll C/B-tier drops
    A: 50% chance
    S: 30% chance
    S+: 20% chance


Additionally, rolling from a certain tier increases the 'dry streak' for every unique-marked drop in that tier by 1. This can occur a maximum of once per loot tier, per kill. The dry streak is reset when that drop is obtained.
If the dry streak reaches 2x the average rate of the drop (i.e. 200 kills for a 1/100 drop) then that kill is rewarded with the drop, guaranteed - regardless of how many other drops were rolled.

Unique-marked drops are rolled separately - when rolling from a tier, there is a small chance (based on tier) that it rolls from the 'unique' table rather than the 'standard' table.

Each Voidshade Hybrid is also guaranteed to drop a token item, used for removing Voidbound tags and other various Slayer items.

Voidshade Rebel: 1-3 Dark Wisps
Voidshade Outlaw: 6-15 Dark Wisps
Voidshade Bandit: 30-60 Dark Wisps
Voidshade Raider: 2-5 Shaded Wisps
Voidshade Exile: 4-13 Shaded Wisps
Voidshade Vanguard: 9-25 Shaded Wisps
Elite Voidshade Vanguard: 17-42 Shaded Wisps
Voidshade Annihilator: 30-70 Shaded Wisps (87.5% chance) OR 1 Void Wisp (12.5% chance)

The Voidshade Annihilator's guaranteed loot is given to each killer, up to a maximum of 5. If more than 6 players participated in the kill, then the top 5 damagers are rewarded instead.

Each player rolls a different set of drops, but only the top 5 damagers will roll any (prioritising the spawner as one of them regardless of damage).

    SUPREME ITEM
    A dark token, belonging to the long lasting Hybrid of Aelzer.

  - Defiant Core
    SUPREME ITEM
    Upon the death of an elite Voidshade Hybrid, the natural fusion that occurs in the Hybrid Nucleus slows down and defies most laws and expectations. Sometimes this fusion decomposes further and the binding that holds the Voidshade Hybrid together falls off.
    Used to craft elite Hybrid Slayer equipment.

  - Ethereal Voidfang
    SUPREME ITEM
    Some Voidshade Hybrids are born with a defective fang, which is unable to be sunk into flesh without decomposing. Even fewer have fangs that mutate, causing them to fall off on death instead of disintegrating.
    Used to craft elite Hybrid Slayer equipment.

  - Proboscis of Descension
    ETERNAL ITEM
    Some Voidshades are born with a proboscis instead of a fang. These can be harvested from hunted Voidshades but most of them disintegrate with the rest of the hybrid body.
    Used to craft the Volatile Mutilator.

  - Hilt of Volatility
    ETERNAL ITEM
    To show off, Voidshades may erect a blade to present to their God. Sometimes, their blade shatters, dropping a precious hilt on the ground.
      Combine with a Volatile Mutilator to grant a new passive.
        Item Passive - No More Running
          Damaging the same target with all four Soul Rupture hits will grant 300 true defence against explosions for 1 second.

  - Amorphous Viscera
    ETERNAL ITEM
    Almost every Voidshade Hybrid has taken form from a construction of corpses. Naturally, Voidshades lack such a form, and their organs move freely around their body, and not all of them take a physical structure on birth. On death, the slowing of fusion causes some organs to rupture and diffuse through the shades of the hybrid body.
    Used to craft the Voidshade Insignia.

  - Derisive Blitzshard
    INFINITE ITEM
    The strongest Voidshade Annihilators carry a shard, which has been claimed to possess the ability to reach out to Rei'Eix himself.
    Used to craft the Virophage Voidblade.
