Agonised Maw Construct (Tier 5)
  80,000 Health
  Damage Cap: 20
  Toughness: 18
  Extra Perks:
    - Only the summoner can hurt the construct.
    - Every 20-34 seconds (randomly picked beforehand, picked again after each new spawn), the Maw Construct summons a Void Spoiler.
    - The Damage Cap value of the construct is the maximum amount of damage that you can deal to it in a single hit. Damage dealt is reduced by a flat amount, equal to the construct's Toughness. Minimum damage dealt is 0.5.
      Various Slayer items can increase the amount of damage that you deal by increasing the Damage Cap value or ignoring a portion of Toughness.

  Abilities:
    - Crystallised Construction (Passive)
      The Construct spawns with 4 Maw Crystals which circle around it. All 4 Maw Crystals must be destroyed, or it cannot be damaged.
      If every Maw Crystal have been destroyed, but it has been at least 60 seconds, they revive with 80% of the amount of health/shields they previously had (multiplicatively).
    - Aether Effigy (Passive)
      Damaging an enemy with an ability or basic attack grants 1 Aether Charge, stacking indefinitely with no cooldown (counts per tick of damage).
      Each Aether Charge grants 9 Defence towards active Maw Crystals and Pyle Constructs, and every 10 AC increases the Maw Construct's Toughness by 1.
    - Dispersion
      The Construct releases an intense wavelength of energy, extending to a 12 block radius. The wavelength stuns enemies for 1 second and marks their current positions. After 1 second passes, the Construct shoots a quick shockwave towards marked positions, dealing 850,000 damage to targets hit.
    - Infestation
      The Construct occasionally shoots out a void tendril in the target direction. The first target hit takes 110,000 damage and is blinded for 2 seconds. The tendril can bounce between targets which are 6 blocks between each other.
      After the tendril expires, the tendril deals 180,000 damage to every affected target, multiplied by the amount of targets.


Maw Crystal (Tier 5)
  450,000,000 Health
  250,000,000 Shields
  750,000 Damage (7 blocks, all enemies in range are attacked)
  Maximum Energy: 260
  Abilities:
    - Defined Protection (Passive)
      Every second, it drains 12 Energy to the Construct it circles around, which prevents it from taking any damage. Only one Maw Crystal will drain its Energy to protect the Construct. If a Maw Crystal is draining its Energy, it deals 50% increased damage and gains +3 block attack range.
      When it runs out of Energy (or can no longer afford the next second of protection), it extends outwards 6 blocks and takes 50% extra damage, stops applying protection to the Construct, and regenerates 10 Energy every second.
    - Psionic Redistribution (Passive)
      If out of combat for at least 8 seconds, regenerate 10% max shields every half second.
    - Field of Spite (Passive)
      Players within 5 blocks have their Bonus Speed, Bonus Attack Speed, Strength, and Crit Damage multiplied by 0.75x. Stacks multiplicatively with other Maw Crystals.
    - Panic Zone (Passive)
      If the Maw Crystal takes more than 16% of its maximum health in a single attack, it channels for 2 seconds. If the channel is successful, it creates an allied Pyle Construct (random choice) nearby which lasts indefinitely or until killed.
      Cancel the channel by applying any form of crowd control to the Maw Crystal.


Rampaging Pyle Construct (Tier 5)
  190,000,000 Health
  190,000,000 Shields
  Abilities:
    - Exiler (Passive)
      Enemies in combat with the Pyle Construct take 3% of their maximum health as true damage every second.
    - Harsh Lining (Passive)
      Up to once every 5 seconds, the next incoming attack deals 99% less damage. Attacks which apply crowd control bypasses this damage reduction and puts it on cooldown again.
    - Rampage Volley
      The Pyle Construct glows for 1 second, before shooting a volley of 50 bolts in the target direction. Each bolt deals 10% of any damaged target's maximum health as true damage on hit.
      Moving past a volley bolt within 0.8 blocks without taking damage from any volley bolt counts as a 'graze'.


Oblivion Pyle Construct (Tier 5)
  120,000,000 Health
  350,000,000 Shields
  Abilities:
    - Animating Aura (Passive)
      Allied Pyle Constructs and Maw Crystals within 16 blocks regenerate 10% of their maximum shields back every second, and gain +200 Shield Defence.
    - Oblivion Orb
      Occasionally, the Pyle Construct charges up for 1 second, before choosing 5 random locations within 10 blocks - prioritising locations underneath enemy players or units. Afterwards, it shoots 2 dark balls near each location, stunning targets hit for 2 seconds and dealing 1,000,000 damage over 5 seconds.
    - Crushing Baseline
      If a unit attempts to walk underneath the Pyle Construct, they are crushed every half second for 80% of their maximum health as true damage, and dealt a large amount of knockback.


Torment Pyle Construct (Tier 5)
  400,000,000 Health
  160,000,000 Shields
  Abilities:
    - Tormenting Transmission (Passive)
      1% of the Pyle Construct's maximum shields are regenerated every second, doubled if out of combat.
      Damage dealt to the Pyle Construct's shields is granted as health regeneration to Pyle Constructs within 10 blocks, at 25% efficiency.
    - Torment Bolt
      The Pyle Construct attacks one target, prioritising targets with lower effective health. The target takes 1,400,000 damage every half second until they die.
      It takes 2.5 seconds for the Pyle Construct to change targets after its target is killed.


Void Spoiler (Tier 5)
  3,000 Health
  125,000 Damage
  Damage Cap: 50
  Toughness: 10
  Abilities:
    - Shield Transfusion (Passive)
      Melee attacks against the Void Spoiler grant a 4% max shield regeneration for Pyle Constructs within 7 blocks.
    - Flesh Spoiler
      Every 2 seconds, the Void Spoiler drains the Defence of every unit within 4 blocks by 10% (stacking multiplicatively). For every 90 Defence drained, the Void Spoiler gains +1 Toughness with no cap.
    - Returning to Serve (Passive)
      Upon death, the Void Spoiler grants its Toughness stat to the Maw Construct, which decays by 1 Toughness every 2 seconds until the bonus depletes.
