Upon defeating Shryder and at least a Voidshade Exile, Maddox grants the ability to fight yet another new Slayer monster.

With a high enough Gathering level, you can gather special items which can be crafted into items which spawns this new slayer monster.
  

You may start a new slayer quest after either successfully beating the last, or every 3 minutes. Cooldowns are applied per boss tier and pause during a slayer quest, but completing a tier refreshes the cooldowns for that tier and the ones below:
  - If you fail to complete a Tier IV slayer, then spend 3 minutes doing a Tier III slayer and beat it successfully, you can do any of Tiers I/II/III, while the Tier IV cooldown remains at 3 minutes.
    - In order for Tier IV to no longer have a cooldown, you must wait 3 minutes without doing any slayers at all.



Slayer Type: Aether Maw Constructs

Constructs do not have a boss timer; they do not despawn due to being too slow to be killed.

Reaching a new Construct Slayer level also unlocks recipes. Crafting an item or obtaining any drop from an Aether Maw Construct marks it as Aetherbound, and means it cannot be used or crafted into something else.

You can give an item to Maddox, and in return of a fee, he will remove the Aetherbound tag for you. This requires the associated Construct Slayer level.

The fee is dependent on the item's Construct Slayer level requirement.

Level | Fee
1 | 4 Splinterye Mesh
2 | 24 Splinterye Mesh
3 | 144 Splinterye Mesh
4 | 12 Augmenting Lattices
5 | 36 Augmenting Lattices
6 | 108 Augmenting Lattices
7 | 5 Eclectic Gemstones
8 | 10 Eclectic Gemstones
9 | 20 Eclectic Gemstones
10 | 40 Eclectic Gemstones
11 | 1 Maw'Eix Crown


Construct Slayer items which are not Aetherbound cannot be traded nor sold. You can talk to Maddox to apply a new Aetherbound tag, which costs an additional fee.

Level | Fee
1 | 500 Tainted Coins
2 | 1,500 Tainted Coins
3 | 4,000 Tainted Coins
4 | 10,500 Tainted Coins
5 | 28,000 Tainted Coins
6 | 60,000 Tainted Coins
7 | 160,000 Tainted Coins
8 | 400,000 Tainted Coins
9 | 1,000,000 Tainted Coins
10 | 2,500,000 Tainted Coins
