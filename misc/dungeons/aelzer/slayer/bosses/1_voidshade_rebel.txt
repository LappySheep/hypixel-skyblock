Voidshade Rebel (Tier 1)
  2,000,000 Health
  120,000 Damage
  20 Defence
  Extra Perks:
    - Ignores 10% of target Defence.
    - Only 3 additional players other than the summoner can hurt the Voidshade.

  Abilities:
    - Role Reversal (Passive)
      Attacking the Voidshade increases its Anger by 1. Every second, its Anger is reduced by 1.
      At 7 Anger, it creates a 5-block explosion, which deals 39% of the target's current health as true damage.
      It also moves twice as fast, and deals 3x the damage, for 5 seconds.

    - Shellshocked (Passive)
      The Voidshade does not take any knockback.
      For every block of knockback that you would normally deal, your damage is increased (multiplicatively) by 10%.
      The Voidshade, however, has a base (and minimum) attack cooldown of 0 ticks.
