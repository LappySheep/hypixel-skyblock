Voidshade Bandit (Tier 3)
  135,000,000 Health
  400,000 Damage
  50 Defence + 380 Magic Resistance
  Perks:
    - Ignores 22% of target Defence.
    - Only 2 additional players other than the summoner can hurt the Voidshade.

  Abilities:
    - Role Reversal (Passive)
      Attacking the Voidshade increases its Anger by 1. Every second, its Anger is reduced by 1.
      At 6 Anger, it creates a 7-block explosion, which deals 63% of the target's current health as true damage.
      It also moves twice as fast, and deals 3x the damage, for 5 seconds.

    - Shellshocked (Passive)
      The Voidshade does not take any knockback.
      For every block of knockback that you would normally deal, your damage is increased (multiplicatively) by 10%.
      The Voidshade, however, has a base (and minimum) attack cooldown of 0 ticks.

    - Peaking Smite
      Occasionally, the Voidshade will stop and channel an attack for 1.5 seconds. Afterwards, it lunges forward, dealing 550,000 damage to targets in front.
      Targets that get hit also have their current Mana and Devotion halved, and regeneration reduced to 0 for 5 seconds.

    - Sinister Suffering (Passive)
      Every time the Voidshade loses 10% of its maximum health, it creates a large red bubble around it and the target.
      The bubble lasts for 3 seconds, and deals 1% of the target's current health as true damage, every second, for every 5% of their missing mana.
      Every third bubble grants the Voidshade a permanent 10% bonus damage reduction (additive), lasting for the rest of the fight.
        The damage reduction only applies to new tiers; if the Voidshade is dropped below 70% and then regenerates to above 70%, this will not occur if it is dropped below 70% again.
