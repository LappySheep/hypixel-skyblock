Voidshade Outlaw (Tier 2)
  17,500,000 Health
  225,000 Damage
  33 Defence + 126 Magic Resistance
  Perks:
    - Ignores 16% of target Defence.
    - Only 2 additional players other than the summoner can hurt the Voidshade.

  Abilities:
    - Role Reversal (Passive)
      Attacking the Voidshade increases its Anger by 1. Every second, its Anger is reduced by 1.
      At 6 Anger, it creates a 6-block explosion, which deals 51% of the target's current health as true damage.
      It also moves twice as fast, and deals 3x the damage, for 5 seconds.

    - Shellshocked (Passive)
      The Voidshade does not take any knockback.
      For every block of knockback that you would normally deal, your damage is increased (multiplicatively) by 10%.
      The Voidshade, however, has a base (and minimum) attack cooldown of 0 ticks.

    - Peaking Smite
      Occasionally, the Voidshade will stop and channel an attack for 1.5 seconds. Afterwards, it lunges forward, dealing 260,000 damage to targets in front.
      Targets that get hit also have their current Mana and Devotion halved, and regeneration reduced to 0 for 5 seconds.
