Upon defeating Pinqsci, Maddox grants the ability to fight a new Slayer monster.

However, unlike the other Slayer types, this one is different. Instead of killing many weaker monsters to fight a boss, this one requires you to only fight the boss. Starting a quest will give you a Fission Tablet, which spawns the boss a few seconds after activating it.

You may start a new slayer quest after either successfully beating the last, or every 3 minutes. Cooldowns are applied per boss tier and pause during a slayer quest, but completing a tier refreshes the cooldowns for that tier and the ones below:
  - If you fail to complete a Tier IV slayer, then spend 3 minutes doing a Tier III slayer and beat it successfully, you can do any of Tiers I/II/III, while the Tier IV cooldown remains at 3 minutes.
    - In order for Tier IV to no longer have a cooldown, you must wait 3 minutes without doing any slayers at all.

Maddox can give you additional Fission Tablets, but the cost is increased by 20% (additively) for every additional tablet other than the first - until a slayer boss is completed. This additive cost increase can be reduced by using Permanent Etching talismans.



Slayer Type: Voidshade Hybrids

Voidshades do not have a boss timer; they do not despawn due to being too slow to be killed.

Reaching a new Hybrid Slayer level also unlocks recipes. Crafting an item or obtaining any drop from a Voidshade Hybrid marks it as Voidbound, and means it cannot be used or crafted into something else.

You can give an item to Maddox, and in return of a fee, he will remove the Voidbound tag for you. This requires the associated Hybrid Slayer level.

The fee is dependent on the item's Hybrid Slayer level requirement.

Level | Fee
1 | 7 Dark Wisps
2 | 18 Dark Wisps
3 | 40 Dark Wisps
4 | 105 Dark Wisps
5 | 1 Shaded Wisp
6 | 2 Shaded Wisps
7 | 4 Shaded Wisps
8 | 8 Shaded Wisps
9 | 16 Shaded Wisps
10 | 32 Shaded Wisps
11 | 64 Shaded Wisps


Hybrid Slayer items which are not Voidbound cannot be traded nor sold. You can talk to Maddox to apply a new Voidbound tag, which costs an additional fee.

Level | Fee
1 | 500 Tainted Coins
2 | 1,500 Tainted Coins
3 | 4,000 Tainted Coins
4 | 10,500 Tainted Coins
5 | 28,000 Tainted Coins
6 | 60,000 Tainted Coins
7 | 160,000 Tainted Coins
8 | 400,000 Tainted Coins
9 | 1,000,000 Tainted Coins
10 | 2,500,000 Tainted Coins
