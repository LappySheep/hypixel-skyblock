Classes can be picked, based on playstyle. Classes gain XP too, just like your Aelzer level. Class Level requirements are the same as Aelzer Level requirements, except 10x lower.

Classes max out at Level 25. Hitting Level 25 (and any other requirements necessary) unlocks subclasses of that class. You do not have to play a subclass, or you could play multiple. Subclasses (or archetypes) max out at Level 40.
