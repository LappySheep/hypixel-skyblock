  150 Defence
  20,000 Damage
  Abilities (short):
    - First Strike:
      The first attack on a target (up to once every 8 seconds) marks the block they were standing on.
      After a short delay, strike the block they were at, and nearby blocks, for 250% damage.
    - Whisper Flux:
      Channel for 1 second before dashing forwards. Passing through a target knocks them up and deals 14,000 damage.
      At any point during the end of the dash, the Eikerlisk can stop abruptly, creating a surge of explosions in the direction it looks in, each one dealing from 8,000 damage upwards, and applying a slow.
    - Aura of Terror:
      Passively, targets which stay within melee range of the Eikerlisk take bonus damage from its melee attacks depending on the duration.

  Abilities (verbose):
    - First Strike:

    - Whisper Flux:
      Channel for 1 second before dashing forwards 12 blocks. Passing through a target knocks them up 12 blocks and deals 14,000 damage.
      At any point after the first 6 blocks, the Eikerlisk can stop abruptly, creating a surge of 7 explosions (5 block radius) in the direction it looks in. Each explosion is separated 3 blocks behind the next, occurring every 2 ticks, and deals 8,000 damage (+2,000 damage per consecutive explosion hit) while also applying a 33% slow for 2 seconds (duration stacks).
      Explosions have a damage diminisher of -16% additive damage per block away from the centre.

      Targets which stay within melee range of the Eikerlisk take 8% bonus damage from its melee attacks for every tick (after the first 3) they remain too close. Range is 5 blocks to begin Aura of Terror, but requires leaving a distance of 6 blocks to cancel it.
      While Aura of Terror is active on a target, they also deal 7.73191% less damage per tick (stacks multiplicatively (0.9226809x), down to a minimum of 20% damage dealt on attacks after 20 ticks, ignoring the first 3).
