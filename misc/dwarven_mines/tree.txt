Starting from a Tier 6 Heart of the Mountain, you unlock a special block of additional Heart of the Mountain perks, which you can acquire by spending Tokens of the Mountain.
These perks do not require a previous perk to be unlocked - only the right amount of tokens and HotM tier.

Each perk is assumed to cost 1 Token of the Mountain to unlock, unless specified otherwise.

You can convert Renown into Mithril Powder, at a 1:100 ratio.
