Upon unlocking Tier 5 of your Heart of the Mountain, commissions will no longer give HotM Exp and instead give Renown.
Only some commissions give Renown. Additionally, commissions now have a counter for how many times a specific one has been finished. At milestones, you may receive bonus rewards.
Renown is used to further unlock HotM Tiers and unlock new - more challenging - commissions and quests.
New/special commissions give the usual Mithril Powder and Mining Exp rewards too.
