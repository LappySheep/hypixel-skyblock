Most recent changes:
  > Spider Slayer:
    > Mosquito Eye drop chance increased (decreased for T3s) and is now a drop from T4/T3.
    > Mosquito Eye drop rate buffed from always 1 to [1-2 for T3s, 1-3 for T4s, 2-4 for T5s]
    > Mosquito Blood duration halved to compensate for cost reduction.
    > Augmented Mosquito Blood changedd to suit new Spider Slayer item capabilities.

  > Creeper Slayer:
    > Recipe of Repaired Meshes uses 32 Enchanted Cobblestone instead of 64.
      [64 doesn't suit the 32-enchanted material pattern, and although cobblestone is cheap, it's tedious to grind for a stack... also makes it more annoying to craft]
    > Explosive Shard drop chance increased to 5x current drop chance because since it is only used for one item.
    > Toxin Pod description changed to be a bit more specific.

  > Spider Slayer:
    > Mosquito Blood now increases the base damage of the Scorpion Bow and the Mosquito Bow too.
    > Augmented Mosquito Blood changed to suit new Spider Slayer item capabilities.

  > Zombie Slayer:
    > Dreadlord Scythe changed to make it more viable outside Zombie Slayer.
    > Augmented Dreadlord Scythe changed to suit new Zombie Slayer weapon capabilities.

  > Blaze Slayer:
    > Added RNGesus drop to slayer 8, not used until slayer 9.
      [Makes the last bow massively harder to acquire, makes it more worthwhile to grind for other than just buying the resources needed]
    > Increased Capacitor requirements from token drops from 32 to 48, but decreased Augmented Wind Blade capacitor requirements from 8 to 6
      [overall increase but allows the third token drop to be added fluidly in the recipe]
    > Augmented Wind Blade changed to suit new Ghast Slayer weapon capabilities.

  > Added Slayer Level 6 Rewards:
    > Revenant / Tarantula minions can be upgraded to collect their signature token drops.
    > Wolf Slayer - "Sven Pup" minions can spawn monsters that drop Wolf Teeth.
    > Creeper Slayer - "Podlet" minions can spawn monsters that drop Blown Meshes.
    > Slime Slayer - "Congealed Cube" minions can spawn monsters that drop Soft Sludge.
    > Enderman Slayer - "Endermite" minions can spawn monsters that drop Lost Pearls.
    > Magma Cube Slayer - "Molten Cube" minions can spawn monsters that drop Tepid Rocks.
    > Ghast Slayer - "Ankou" minions can spawn monsters that drop Phantom Tears.
    > Blaze Slayer - "Rod Mythic" minions can spawn monsters that drop Cinder Powders.
    (Level 5 instead of 6 for blaze)
      [Level 6 is the point where progression feels less evident - having token drops more accessible will make it easier to advance from this stage]

  > Ghast Slayer:
    > Wind Blade's "Vengeful Flight" will not deal AoE damage if used while out of combat (extended flight)
      [Would be too strong - use it at the start while out of combat and you have 45% max hp damage for free, effortless]
