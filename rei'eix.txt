Rei'Eix, the Embodiment of the Rift

Rei'Eix is a powerful, but fallen god. After having bound his soul to the dimension between existence and death, his lifeforce had slowly drained while attempting to keep the two dimensions separate. Unfortunately, this strength died out and in an attempt to rebuild his strength, he has seeked destruction on the land he was once determined to keep safe.

Rei'Eix will rarely appear on public islands (1 / 23,750,000 chance per player per second) to challenge a single player; appearing in front of them and sending a request. The player may decline and Rei'Eix will mutter that you are weak and disappear after 5 seconds. During these 5 seconds, any other player may challenge Rei'Eix.

While in the challenged state, you may party up to 4 players (5 total) for the duel. If there are more than 5 players, the first 5 that join will be placed in a new party temporarily.



Upon either accepting Rei'Eix's challenge, or upon challenging him, you will be teleported to a dungeon of which he resides in.

Accessing the dungeon will give you the option to trade 15,000,000 coins to revisit the dungeon, should you want to challenge him again.




There is also a shop that has 3 items, that may support you in the fight:

- Abyssal Skull [6,000,000 Coins] or [7 Rift Fragments]
    - +175 Health
    - +70 Defence
    - Damage taken by Rift monsters is reduced by 1.1% for every 1% of your maximum health that you are missing. (minimum 34% at 40% max hp) 
    
- Abyssal Breastplate [12,500,000 Coins] or [15 Rift Fragments]
    - +250 Health
    - +70 Defence
    - 3% of damage taken by Rei'Eix is converted into grey health. Killing a Rift Monster will convert all of your grey health into actual health.
    
- Abyssal Blade [20,000,000 Coins] or [25 Rift Fragments]
    - +120 Damage
    - +120 Strength
    - Item Passive: Cursed Enchanter
        - Enchants on this weapon are not active outside of the Rift Dungeon.
    - Item Ability: Shadow Strike
        - You strike all targets in a 30 degree cone of radius 4 blocks in the target direction. Targets hit take 1000 true damage (increased to 2000 for Rift Monsters, increased to 5000 for Rei'Eix) over 6 seconds (reduced to 5 seconds for Rift Monsters, reduced to 4 seconds for Rei'Eix).
        - Costs 250 Mana.
        - No cooldown.




You will have to fight a horde of weaker monsters that guard the main room of the dungeon.



[Level 75] Rift Spawn (36000 HP)
> Deals 2000 on melee hit.
> 3-block aura that damages all players for 3% of their missing health as true damage. 25% of damage dealt by the aura will be restored as health back.
> 6% chance to drop a Rift Fragment (needed for boss fight).

[Level 70] Rift Dryad (32500 HP)

[Level 85] Rift Phantom (25000 HP)
> 5% of damage taken is deflected to all (not split) players within 6 blocks.
> No basic attack.
> Occasionally jumps in front of other Rift monsters to block projectiles that may harm them.
> 9% chance to drop a Rift Fragment (needed for boss fight).


Rift Fragment (RARE) [not stackable]
A weakened fragment of the Rift that emanates chaotic energies. Each Rift Fragment in your inventory will boost your HP regen by 0.2/s.
Merchants cannot buy this item.
Leaving the dungeon will remove all traces of Rift Fragments from your inventory, ender chest, and backpacks.





Upon finding the room, you are offered one final opportunity to leave. You can confirm you want to enter by having a player in your party (or you, if solo) deposit a single Rift Fragment in the door.

Notes:
- Dying will kick you out of the dungeon; you cannot spectate the fight.
- All players in the party must take part in the boss fight.
- All items in your inventory and 90% of your money will drop on to the floor should you die, and an ally may pick up your items within the next 20 seconds, if they wish to preserve them.
- Items such as Saving Grace that prevent death directly (unlike Second Wind passive from Spirit Mask) will be disabled.

Phase 0
-------
Rei'Eix - Boss Fight

Rei'Eix will start by crashing down at the centre of the boss room. The boss room is 80x80. All players within 30 blocks of the centre will be knocked back up to 50 blocks and will take 33% of their maximum health as true damage.

"You came here seeking strength. Bring it to me."




------
Phase 1
------
Phase 1 / 6:

Rei'Eix has 40,000,000 HP in this phase.

There are five pillars in the room; 1 in each corner, and one at the centre of the room. Each pillar may be lit by attacking it with either a bow enchanted with Flame or a melee weapon enchanted with Fire Aspect. After 1000 fire damage has been dealt, the pillar will be set alight for the next 75 seconds.

For each pillar that is not lit, Rei'Eix takes 25% less damage (5 unlit pillars = attacks heal Rei'Eix for 25% of the damage).

He attacks nearby players for 3500 melee damage up to every 1.25 seconds. Each melee attack cleaves targets within 7.5 blocks for 45% of the unmitigated damage dealt.

Dying during this phase will cause Rei'Eix to restore 5% of his missing health back and cause up to 2 pillars to be extinguished. If a player dies while 0 pillars are lit, all other players take 10,000 damage split across all players and are placed in stasis for 2 seconds; rendering them unable to move, attack, be attacked, or perform any actions during this time.

Occasionally, Rei'Eix will spawn <Rift Spawn>s and <Rift Phantom>s near him.

At 36m, 32m, 28m, 24m, 20m, 16m, 12m, 8m, 4m, and at 1HP, Rei'Eix will become temporarily invulnerable. While invulnerable, he will spawn <Rift Dryad>s every few seconds, but will not attack nor move. Players must attack Rei'Eix with Rift Fragments (total 5 per instance) to cancel the invulnerability.
Upon starting and cancelling invulnerability, Rei'Eix releases a single dense ball of chaotic energy at each player, which follows them for either 60 seconds or until it hits the associated target player. Each ball deals up to 8000 damage.

At 27m, 14m, and 1m HP, Rei'Eix will channel for 3 seconds, before releasing a powerful shockwave of energy. This shockwave stuns players within 10 blocks for 6 seconds, and creates a radiation aura that damages every player in the room for 1% of their maximum health as true damage every second and disables natural regeneration, until a Rift Fragment is used on Rei'Eix.
