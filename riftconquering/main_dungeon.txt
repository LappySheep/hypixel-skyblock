Rei'Eix, the Embodiment of the Rift

Rei'Eix is a powerful, but fallen god. After having bound his soul to the dimension between existence and death, his lifeforce had slowly drained while attempting to keep the two dimensions separate. Unfortunately, this strength died out and in an attempt to rebuild his strength, he has sought destruction on the land he was once determined to keep safe.

Rei'Eix will rarely appear on public islands (11 / 390,000,000 chance per player per second) to challenge a single player; appearing in front of them and sending a request. The player may decline and Rei'Eix will mutter that you are weak and disappear after 5 seconds. During these 5 seconds, any other player may challenge Rei'Eix.

While in the challenged state, you may party up to 4 players (5 total) for the duel. If there are more than 5 players, the first 5 that join will be placed in a new party temporarily.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon either accepting Rei'Eix's challenge, or upon challenging him, you will be teleported to a dungeon of which he resides in.

Accessing the dungeon will give you the option to trade 15,000,000 coins to revisit the dungeon, should you want to challenge him again.




Notes:
- Dying will kick you out of the dungeon; you cannot spectate the fight.
- All players in the party must take part in the boss fight.
- All items in your inventory and 90% of your money will drop on to the floor should you die, and an ally may pick up your items within the next 20 seconds, if they wish to preserve them.
- Items such as Saving Grace that prevent death directly (unlike Second Wind passive from Spirit Mask) will be disabled.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rift Dungeon

There is an enchantment table that allows you to enchant weapons/armor (including already enchanted weapons/armor) with a bonus enchantment. You can only have 1 bonus enchantment at any time. If there is a bonus enchantment on a weapon/armor piece, you can enchant it again to upgrade the enchant by 1 level.

Each enchant costs Tainted Coins along with experience orbs (I: 1 TCoin, II: 50 TCoins, III: 3,000 TCoins, IV: 150,000 TCoins, V: 8,000,000 TCoins)

Empowered enchantment levels (1 higher than standard maximum) are also available drops from some Rift Monsters.

You can pay Tainted Coins (equal to twice the enchantment level cost) to Linc to clear your weapon of the bonus enchantments, if you do not want it anymore.
