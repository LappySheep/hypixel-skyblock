# Rei'Eix, the Embodiment of the Rift

Rei'Eix is a powerful, but fallen god. After having bound his soul to the dimension between existence and death, his lifeforce had slowly drained while attempting to keep the two dimensions separate. Unfortunately, this strength died out and in an attempt to rebuild his strength, he has seeked destruction on the land he was once determined to keep safe.
<br /><br />
Rei'Eix will rarely appear on public islands (1 / 23,750,000 chance per player per second) to challenge a single player; appearing in front of them and sending a request. The player may decline and Rei'Eix will mutter that you are weak and disappear after 5 seconds. During these 5 seconds, any other player may challenge Rei'Eix.
<br /><br />
While in the challenged state, you may party up to 4 players (5 total) for the duel. If there are more than 5 players, the first 5 that join will be placed in a new party temporarily.

<br /><br /><br />

Upon either accepting Rei'Eix's challenge, or upon challenging him, you will be teleported to a dungeon of which he resides in.
<br />
Accessing the dungeon will give you the option to trade 15,000,000 coins to revisit the dungeon, should you want to challenge him again.


<br /><br /><br />

There is also a shop that has 3 items, that may support you in the fight:

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


Upon finding the room, you are offered one final opportunity to leave. You can confirm you want to enter by having a player in your party (or you, if solo) deposit a single Rift Fragment in the door.
<br />
Notes:
<br />- Dying will kick you out of the dungeon; you cannot spectate the fight.
<br />- All players in the party must take part in the boss fight.
<br />- All items in your inventory and 90% of your money will drop on to the floor should you die, and an ally may pick up your items within the next 20 seconds, if they wish to preserve them.
<br />- Items such as Saving Grace that prevent death directly (unlike Second Wind passive from Spirit Mask) will be disabled.

<br />Phase 0
<br />-------
<br />Rei'Eix - Boss Fight
<br />
<br />Rei'Eix will start by crashing down at the centre of the boss room. The boss room is 80x80. All players within 30 blocks of the centre will be knocked back up to 50 blocks and will take 33% of their maximum health as true damage.
<br />
<br />"You came here seeking strength. Bring it to me."


<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

------
<br />Phase 1 / 6:
<br />------
<br />
<br />Rei'Eix has 40,000,000 HP in this phase.
<br />
<br />There are five pillars in the room; 1 in each corner, and one at the centre of the room. Each pillar may be lit by attacking it with either a bow enchanted with Flame or a melee weapon enchanted with Fire Aspect. After 1000 fire damage has been dealt, the pillar will be set alight for the next 75 seconds.
<br />
<br />For each pillar that is not lit, Rei'Eix takes 25% less damage (5 unlit pillars = attacks heal Rei'Eix for 25% of the damage).
<br />
<br />He attacks nearby players for 3500 melee damage up to every 1.25 seconds. Each melee attack cleaves targets within 7.5 blocks for 45% of the unmitigated damage dealt.
<br />
<br />Dying during this phase will cause Rei'Eix to restore 5% of his missing health back and cause up to 2 pillars to be extinguished. If a player dies while 0 pillars are lit, all other players take 10,000 damage split across all players and are placed in stasis for 2 seconds; rendering them unable to move, attack, be attacked, or perform any actions during this time.
<br />
<br />Occasionally, Rei'Eix will spawn <Rift Spawn>s and <Rift Phantom>s near him.
<br />
<br />At 36m, 32m, 28m, 24m, 20m, 16m, 12m, 8m, 4m, and at 1HP, Rei'Eix will become temporarily invulnerable. While invulnerable, he will spawn <Rift Dryad>s every few seconds, but will not attack nor move. Players must attack Rei'Eix with Rift Fragments (total 5 per instance) to cancel the invulnerability.
<br />Upon starting and cancelling invulnerability, Rei'Eix releases a single dense ball of chaotic energy at each player, which follows them for either 60 seconds or until it hits the associated target player. Each ball deals up to 8000 damage.
<br />
<br />At 27m, 14m, and 1m HP, Rei'Eix will channel for 3 seconds, before releasing a powerful shockwave of energy. This shockwave stuns players within 10 blocks for 6 seconds, and creates a radiation aura that damages every player in the room for 1% of their maximum health as true damage every second and disables natural regeneration, until a Rift Fragment is used on Rei'Eix.
<br />


<br />Upon losing all HP in this phase, Rei'Eix's flesh will rupture slightly, revealing a purple taint coming out. The ground will crumble, causing some land to be destroyed.
<br />
<br />All 5 pillars will crumble into a mess in their respective areas.
<br />
<br />"In your recklessness, you mistake my presence as your downfall. You will be eliminated. No trace of your humanity will remain."
<br />
<br />A chunk of Rei'Eix's flesh drops to the ground. All players can equip the [Tainted Flesh] (Boots).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Tainted Flesh (EPIC)
<br />+150 Health
<br />+90 Defence
<br />+5% Speed
<br />+25 Intelligence
<br />A collapsed portion of Rei'Eix's body. Wearing this (Boots) will allow you to double jump up to once every 7.5 seconds with no mana cost.
<br />Item Passive: Empowering Taint
<br />- Killing a Rift Spawn will permanently improve the Tainted Flesh by 2 Health (up to a cap of 100).
<br />- Killing a Rift Dryad will permanently improve the Tainted Flesh by 1 Intelligence (up to a cap of 50).
<br />- Killing a Rift Phantom will permanently improve the Tainted Flesh by 0.5% Dodge Chance (up to a cap of 25%).
<br />- For each stat bonus capped by Empowering Taint, killing their respective Rift Monster will instead restore 1% of your missing health back (all 3 stats capped: 4% missing health restored (instead of 3%)).
<br />Merchants cannot buy this item.
<br />Leaving the dungeon will remove all traces of Rift Fragments from your inventory, ender chest, and backpacks.
