    Apply to any bow up to 4 times. Each application grants +5 Weapon Damage and +2.5% Crit Chance.
    Blaze Slayer requirement is for crafting and applying on to a bow, but is not required to use a bow with any HFS applied to it.

    +425 Damage
    +300% Crit Damage
    +60 True Defense
    Item Passive - Absurd Quiver
      Every 1 second (affected by ATS), the Shieldbow gains 1 stack, and shoots arrows instantly if stacks are consumed. Maximum of 10 stored stacks. Shots which do not consume stacks cannot crit, but stack-shots have 0 cooldown in between.
    Item Passive - Shieldbow
      While sneaking, the Shieldbow's bonus Crit Damage is converted into Defense at 50% efficiency. While not sneaking, gain bonus Crit Damage equal to 15% of your Defense (max 20% of your current Crit Damage).
      Landing stack-shots grants +10 bonus Defense and +2 bonus Crit Damage, stacking infinitely, but lasting for only 1 second (refreshing on hits).
    Item Ability - Blazing Ephemerality LEFT CLICK
      You fire 15 fully charged arrows in the target direction in a cone (3deg between arrows).
      Each arrow deals 25% damage and applies on-hit effects, but marks each target damaged for 8 seconds.
      Marked targets take 1% of their maximum health as fire damage every 0.5s until they die (max 5s for bosses), and deal 33% less damage towards you.
      Killing a marked target with any melee attack or any arrow restores 10% of your missing mana back, and grants a 15% max hp shield lasting for 2 seconds.
      Mana Cost: 450
      Cooldown: 30s (reduced by 2s per arrow landed with the Shieldbow)

  10*: 25,000 Crimson Essence + Inferno Apex + 16 Infernum Gemstones + 15 Inferno Vertexes

  (10* cumulative: 106,500 crimson essence + 2 inferno apexes + 36 inferno vertexes + 16 infernum gemstones)
  (normal 10*: cata 50 + 5* + 5m* => 6.4x stats)
  (this bow 10* + 5 master stars: 1.2x multiplier from 10*, then cata 50+5m* -> 1.2 * 5.9 = 7.08x)
