a new npc near the nucleus can be spoken to, lets call them greg, blah blah they ask you if you have heard of divan before, obviously you say no, they talk for a bit about how divan was an ancient fabled miner and mined a lot blah blah blah

on divan's death bed he created a will which allowed worthy players to inherit a portion of his wealth, hence introducing the concept of doing nucleus runs

after doing your first run, you talk to greg again, he talks about how divan created the paths towards the nucleus as a 'beacon of hope' that new powerful and rare ores could be discovered

he talks about how divan had a blueprint for the 'perfect alloy', an alloy which would be able to forge the strongest tool possible

after the talk, he reveals that he himself has been working on the task of attempting to find this fabled alloy and tells the player that if they help him retire by finding small fragments that divan left behind, he can give the player the alloy's blueprint (forging recipe)

greg now offers the player the ability to give him rare nucleus finds and rare crystal hollows items to earn renown - earn enough renown to 'tier up' the ladder of rewards

sources of renown (items must be obtained by you):
  divan fragment -> 7 renown
  jaderald -> 13 renown
  recall potion -> 55 renown
  precious pearl -> 55 renown
  quick claw -> 160 renown
  any flawless gemstone (jasper/opal is worth 20% more) -> 15 renown
  any perfect gemstone (jasper/opal is worth 25% more) -> 80 renown

for a one time fee of 500 renown, greg will cast a magical spell to allow you to place crystals and claim your nucleus rewards far away from the nucleus, but can only be done inside of a fairy grotto or near bal, as this spell requires a lot of harnessed energy
