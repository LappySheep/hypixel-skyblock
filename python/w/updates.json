          "SkyBlock has been around the Minecraft community for more than 7 years, longer than the Hypixel Network! Even though the game has evolved a lot through the years, the idea remains the same:",
          "Players start on a tiny island with almost nothing and quickly start unlocking and collecting resources, expand their island, combat monsters, then create farms and explore all their options.",
          "There are many ways to play SkyBlock, and we have decided to create our own special way.",
          "[SIZE=6]▶ [COLOR=rgb(179, 89, 0)]How to play Hypixel SkyBlock?[/COLOR][/SIZE]",
          "You can go in the [U]Prototype Lobby[/U], or you can directly click on SkyBlock in the compass. There is also a SkyBlock NPC in the main lobby!",
          "You can also easily join using the [B]/play skyblock[/B] command.",
          "SkyBlock can be played alone or with friends in Co-op! See more co-op information below.",
          "You can play SkyBlock on any Minecraft version, but we recommend using 1.8.9 as it is still the most stable version!",
          "[SIZE=6]▶ [COLOR=#b35900]Why Prototype?[/COLOR][/SIZE]",
          "The game is still in development - there are ''coming soon'' features and a lot of balancing to do - but during the last few weeks of testing we have been having a lot of fun playing. If we are having fun, then the game is ready for prototype!",
          "As such, please make sure you report any bugs or exploits as soon as possible so we can fix them fast. The best way to do so is to use our [URL='https://hypixel.net/bug-reports/create']bug report form[/URL].",

Also, we were having quite a bit of fun already, so why not!",

          "Hey Everyone",
          "SkyBlock on Hypixel started on June 11 2019, and we are very impressed by its success. It has been more than 6 months since it's first appearance in the prototype lobby now.",
          "[break][/break]",
          "SkyBlock was the team's first real foray into the PvE side of Minecraft - after years of Hypixel success, it is impressive how long it took for us to really try our hands at SkyBlock. We've had other PvE games before of course, like Blocking Dead for example, but they've always been on a ''small match'' system, never on a permanent live environment. As such, it is always a fun challenge to fight against exploits, dupes or any form of cheating, as unlike other games these exploits can really ruin the economy.",
          "Considering all of this, we are obviously willing to do all it takes to ensure the economy of SkyBlock on Hypixel stays healthy. For that reason, we have decided to start enforcing some new, harsher rules. In other words, it is time we start cracking down on boosting and exploiting. This post will touch upon rules we're adding to SkyBlock, as well as talking about 2FA.",
          "[B]A massive community",
          "[/B]",
          "3,620,257 total unique players have joined SkyBlock",
          "1,779,183 unique players have maxed out at least 1 collection",
          "There is a lot going on behind the scenes on SkyBlock, from figuring out and fixing exploits/dupes to acting against major boosters. Making yourself rich using boosting techniques and exploits, you may be benefitting yourself, however, you are hurting the health of the whole community of SkyBlock.",
          "We have updated the Hypixel Rules page with the following information:",
          "[B]SkyBlock Rules Overview",
          "[/B]",
          "[LIST=1]",
          "[*]Being AFK is only allowed as long there is no use of 3rd party items such as modifications packs, items, auto clickers, software and/or hardware.",
          "[*]Trading across profiles is allowed as long as it is non-abusive and is not boosting your profile with specific materials or items.",
          "[*]Scamming is not allowed but players are responsible for making informed and responsible decisions when trading materials and items. Make sure you use the /report command in-game if you are a victim of scamming (and select the appropriate chat) and staff will review the situation.",
          "[*]The use of blacklisted modifications is not allowed.",
          "[*]Inappropriate builds are not allowed.",
          "[/LIST]",

          "Do note that we definitely reserve the right to take action against your account and/or profile should we catch players breaking these rules. This may result in the deletion of profile progress, deletion of profiles altogether and even ban from the game and/or network. If you are engaging in any of these behaviors, I would strongly suggest stopping immediately.",
          "Finally, I should mention that to the majority of players - these rules should be of no concern. We target people who abuse - these players know who they are. As always, however, and I cannot repeat this enough: if you have to ask if what you are doing is fine, then you already know it most likely isn't.",
          "[B]2FA on Hypixel",
          "[/B]",
          "Recently there has been a lot of talks about accounts stealing around SkyBlock. After The Pit, SkyBlock is the second game now to have a permanent inventory and an economy surrounding it. With its cross-world profile system with co-ops and giant player base, as well as an auction house, items now have a real value to them, making SkyBlock profiles a target for stealing.",
          "Sadly, it is not possible for Hypixel to enforce a 2FA rule on the entirety of the server. While it sounds like 2FA is a simple solution, implementing it the wrong way would only actually increase the number of tools at the disposal of people stealing accounts. Players who wouldn't want to use 2FA would become even more at risk of getting compromised. Furthermore, we can't really have any say in what happens to your Minecraft account in itself, nor can we really help secure it, as it is not our systems. Any attempts to make 2FA on our side has met with issues left and right, and it never really felt ''right''. Finally, the required increase in support personnel just to deal with this issue would increase tremendously - people have a tendency to need help with this stuff on a daily basis. Since we don't control Minecraft accounts, it is never really entirely possible for us to prove ownership of an account from anyone. This leaves the 2FA system extremely vulnerable to social engineering.",
          "At the end of the day, account security always remains the account owner's responsibility. We are not Mojang, and Minecraft accounts are in no way under our control, and as such, only Mojang and Microsoft can really come up with solutions to secure your accounts. We would love to do it ourselves, but it shouldn't be up to us, really.",
          "It is very important that each and every one of you takes the necessary steps to ensure your account is safe. Never share your passwords with anyone you don't fully trust. I'd even say don't share it with anyone at all. Make sure your passwords are as long as you can and as random as it is. The more different characters there is, the stronger a password is. Words aren't good passwords, neither are dates. The best passwords are those that are completely random numbers and letters. Another very important thing to avoid is sharing passwords between different services. If you have the same password on your email address and Minecraft account, for example, it would be very easy after hijacking one to access the other.",
          "Be careful of what mods you are installing, and do not share text or crash logs with anyone you don't fully trust. Some of these can and will be used to try and break into your account. Be extra careful."

          "When you unlock a new Pet, it will be level 1. By playing SkyBlock with your pet, it will level up to a maximum of level 100. Pets are linked to a skill - for example, a farming pet will mostly earn experience through farming. Leveling a pet will increase the stats it gives you, as well as improve its perks.",
          "Pets can be different rarities, from Common to Legendary. A higher rarity pet will give you more perks!",
          "There were 2 pets in the game already who have been incorporated into this system, and we have now added 26 new ones. This means there are now [B]28 pets[/B]!",

          "We would like to apologize for the lack of information coming from us lately regarding Dungeons; the community is due for a progress update on what we are currently working on.",
          "When we started working on Dungeons we had several ideas on how it should be implemented, and we decided to go with the most impressive one as we believe it'll be worth it in the long run. What this meant sadly was that SkyBlock would not have major updates for a while. However, we really wanted to bring you guys what we think is the best version of what SkyBlock Dungeons can be.",
          "While we rarely spoil projects ahead of time, today we'll explain what SkyBlock Dungeons are:",
          "[B]Randomly generated[/B]",
          "Dungeons are small randomly generated labyrinths. Some things will change, but some other aspects will remain consistent because we want to make sure the difficulty is approximately the same every time, good or bad luck should not be involved.",
          "[IMG]https://staticassets.hypixel.net/news/5e503cfcc87c0.DungeonRoom.png[/IMG]",
          "[SIZE=2][COLOR=rgb(128, 128, 128)]Work in progress[/COLOR][/SIZE]",
          "[B]Team Experience[/B]",
          "While Solo mode may be released eventually, we want to encourage players to find a party and develop a strategy together before entering. Some of the best memories players can make, are with their friends, having an adventure together. Hypixel used to be known for its adventure maps many years ago, this is the experience we want to bring back, and more. There is a strong chance we will prove players with a way to find groups for dungeons, as we still don't want solo players to be left completely stranded.",
          "[B]",
          "New monster technology[/B]",
          "All the monsters in Dungeons are special, and almost all of them will have some kind of interesting mechanic. We do not want mobs to be overloaded with moves, we understand ''bad'' mobs are important, but they should feel more alive than the vanilla Minecraft AI - not everything should act like a zombie!",
          "Mobs in Minecraft, in general, are very limited, which is why we started working on new technologies to create new kind of mobs. There is so much we can do with them, we can't wait to show them off, and we really hope to catch you guys off guard with our bosses!",
          "[B]Many different difficulty tiers[/B]",
          "The Dungeon will have a certain amount of floors, and each floor with a different Boss at the end. Everyone will start on the first floor and will have to beat the floor's boss to unlock the next one. Each floor will be exponentially harder than the last.",
          "[B]Exploration[/B]",
          "We want Dungeons to be a constant learning experience. As players run dungeons, they will understand them more and more and become more familiar with the potential layouts. While each Dungeon will have a path going from the entrance to the boss room, players will also be encouraged to venture outside of that path and explore the rest of the Dungeon, solve puzzles, avoid traps, encounter mini-bosses. The more you'll explore the Dungeon, the strongest your team will be when facing the boss.",

          "[B]Strategy[/B]",
          "Dungeons will have a learning curve, and while the first couple floors will be simple, you will eventually get your butt kicked, forcing you to go back and improve your gear and skills.",
          "Five dungeon classes will be introduced on release, each with very specific strengths.",
          "[B]",
          "Almost infinite progression[/B]",
          "Every item found in Dungeons will be new and unique. The Dungeoneering skill will not only level up your classes but also buff your Dungeon items, which will allow us to create monsters extremely strong in the last few floors.",
          "[B]Rewards[/B]",
          "Not including drops from mobs, Dungeon Bosses will reward some of the strongest weapons in the game, and powerful item modifiers, such as new reforges, Ultimate Enchantments and more.",
          "[B]And much more[/B]",
          "We could go on and talk about the Dungeon Map, exploration-scoring system, salvaging system, shop, dungeon passes, party finder, aggro system, wardrobe, death mechanics and so on, but we have said enough for now!",
          "[B]Are we done yet?[/B]",
          "To be completely honest, we do not know when Dungeons will be ready, every day brings a load of new tasks. There are still many mobs on the list, many items, several bosses, many mechanics unfinished. At the end of the day, we want to release when we truly believe Dungeons is a fun and rewarding experience for players.",
          "While we cannot accurately say when we'll be ready for release yet, we believe a rough estimate places dungeons for late March or early April. Please understand that this could change depending on how we feel about the content as it approaches completion.",

          "With more and more accessories being added to the game, it was important to take power away from them and transfer it to weapons and armors. With new accessories being less of a power boost, that enables us to release more and more ways to enlarge the accessory bag and release new accessories along with them.",
          "For players who currently have nearly all accessories in the game, initially this will result in an overall nerf. But with the introduction of the new Reforge Stones and Mythic rarity, it'll end up in a sizable buff.",
          "[B]Universal reforges[/B] [B]can only be applied to accessories from now on.[/B]",
          "Those are reforges that apply not only on talismans, but also on other type of gear. It became impossible to balance the game around core pieces of gear being on the same power level as mere accessories. If you are still using universal reforges on armors or weapons, they will stay and you could keep them for fun, but those are now strictly worse than gear reforges. You may want to replace them.",
          "[B]Critical Chance removed from almost all accessory reforges, but a lot easier to get on armors and weapons.[/B]",
          "Critical Chance is an important statistic to always have maxed out, but it being on accessories was making it not only complex to min-max your build, but also a mandatory accessory build.",
          "[B]The Base Critical chance of players is now buffed up by 10% (from 20 to 30%)",
          "However the Combat skill now rewards only 0.5 Critical Chance per level, instead of 1%[/B].",
          "While we do want skills to become a more central part of the game, the Combat skill is currently miles ahead of others, with it not only granting 50% Critical Chance, but also giving 300% damage on monsters. Unpleasant still grants Critical Chance, if you are struggling to reach 100% critical chance, you can reforge a few Common accessories with Unpleasant.",
          "[B][SIZE=5]Build Diversity[/SIZE][/B]",

          "[B]The weight of all reforges is now the same[/B]",
          "There is no rare reforge option anymore. If you want Legendary on your sword now, the odds are simply 1 out of 9. This is of course complimented by the fact that there are less (bad) options in the armor/weapon pool.",

Getting the correct reforge on your items can be very cheap, or extremely expensive. Players should know the price of reforges and they should decide if they want to reforge, based on those prices.",
          "That is why we are introducing [B]Reforge Stones[/B]. Those can be used to reforge specific items, or your entire accessory bag, with a specific reforge attached to the stone. Those are meant to be overall stronger than the current reforges, so eventually players use those whenever they decide to change reforges.

          "This affected everyone, but it was a lot more severe on players with low intelligence values.",

          "[I]The Crystal Hollows adds unique mining content, a lot of new items and collections, and a new unique way to enhance armor. [/I]",
          "[B]New Island tied to the Foraging Skill - Later in 2021[/B]",
          "[I]Foraging needs an update as massive as Mining got with the Crystal Hollows. However, what we are currently planning is nothing anyone could ever guess. More details later!",
          "[B]Revamp of an old Classic - Later in 2021[/B]",
          "We will be picking up a combat island that is, let's be honest, completely useless at the moment in the current player progression. I'm sure you guys can figure out which it is just by saying this. Please note that there is a chance this revamp is pushed to 1.0, but at the moment we are planning on releasing it before.",
          "We'll be changing this island so much that at this point it is basically a completely new island. It will also be in a different spot in player progression (late game).[/I]",
          "[B]SkyBlock Official 1.0 Release - Sometime in 2022[/B]",
          "[I]We have MASSIVE plans for 1.0, and compared to the current game, this will feel like an [B]expansion[/B]. This update should come with a[B] LOT of content like new islands and features[/B], which we will provide more information about in the next few months, as well as a complete rebalance of the entire game. The game will leave the Prototype Lobby at that point.",
          "Please note that development is at an extremely early phase for 1.0, and we have no clue when it will be released. If you get too hyped and we delay this to 2023, don't say I didn't warn you.[/I]",
          "[B]After 1.0 Release[/B]",
          "[I]For any content that comes after 1.0, we are considering the possibility of using recent Minecraft version releases to add even more content to the game. This is an idea we are still exploring, and may not necessarily become a reality (as it would force players to play SkyBlock on the most recent version of Minecraft only), but it is on the table. Think new monsters, better UI, highlights, new blocks etc.[/I]",
          "[B][SIZE=5]►[/SIZE][/B] [COLOR=rgb(231, 135, 26)][SIZE=6][B]Wait a minute, did you just write complete rebalance of the entire game with 1.0 release?[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]",
          "Oh that, yeah, I did just write that.",
          "There has been a lot of controversies around recent nerfs and I'd like to address them. First, major nerfs don't come to the game without a lot of thought, we don't just throw them in. All the game designers sit down and figure out if it's a good idea or not, then one dev makes it happen. Blame shouldn't fall on the person who released it, if there is any to be given.",
          "Ultimately, when we nerf content or items in the game, we do it for the health of the game as a whole. As an example, the Strength nerf was necessary, as player damage was reaching ludicrous amounts in some edge cases. Everyone got hit by it, but ultimately, the entirety of the game kept the same difficulty with some rare scenarios requiring maybe one more hit or two.",
          "Now, what's this about a rebalance? As some of you must have noticed, there is an insane discrepancy between the top 1% of players and the rest. Balance in SkyBlock combat is all over the place and not every item makes sense. For the 1.0 release, we will be revisiting every aspect of the game and changing numbers everywhere. It's a lot of math.",
          "The reason for this is the corner we pushed ourselves into for combat content releases. When making new end game combat content, we're at a point where if we make it challenging to end game players, mid game players can't even consider trying it, while the min-max top end player can just come in and one shot that the whole thing. If we balance content around this top player, then only 1% of the player base even stands a chance.",
          "While everyone's first impression of the rebalancing will be that they are hitting less hard than before, enemy health will be lowered to follow this change. We're hoping most content will keep the same ''difficulty level'', but without having to reach billions of damage per hit. At the same time, we're hoping to buff items, classes, and playstyles that have been left behind, and early game items should be less worthless than they are now.",
          "Please note that we will be conducting a lot of testing sessions with Alpha Net for this new rebalance to make sense at various stages of its development.", "[B][SIZE=5]►[/SIZE][/B] [COLOR=rgb(231, 135, 26)][SIZE=6][B]All I hear is SkyBlock, what about my favorite games on Hypixel?[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]",
          "Alpha Net is sadly only for SkyBlock, due to the nature of its economy and persistence of inventories. However, I still come bearing good news, as we do have plans to update older games on the network. Bed Wars is doing absolutely amazing in popularity and will be getting an update before the end of the year, maybe ([B]MAYBE[/B]) even before the end of Summer. While other games have not been doing as great, there is a few that deserves some attention and we will be updating them soon too. I can't tell which games yet, nor can I say in which order, or when. There's no point in making promises if we don't know when we can keep them."
